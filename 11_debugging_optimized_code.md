# Debugging Optimized Code
With help from debugging information generated by the compiler, gdb can map from the running program back to constructs from your original source.

## Inline Functions

gdb displays inlined functions just like non-inlined functions. They appear in backtraces. You can view their arguments and local variables, step into them with step, skip them with next, and escape from them with finish. You can check whether a function was inlined by using the info frame command.

## Tail Call Frames

什么叫tail call

Function B can call function C in its very last statement. In unoptimized compilation the call of C is immediately followed by return instruction at the end of B code. Optimizing compiler may replace the call and return in function B into one jump to function C instead. Such use of a jump instruction is called tail call.

B函数在最后一行调用了C，如果是没有优化的代码，call c后面就是ret语句。优化的代码会去掉call调用和ret ,改为一条jump语句，这就是tail call
